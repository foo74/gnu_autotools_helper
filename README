# gnu_autotools_helper
A helper script to create a template GNU autotools project.

Make sure to chmod +x the script. It builds a C template project that works
with GNU Autotools (autoconf and automake). Currently only builds with src
subdirectory. If you need man, doc, etc subdirs then add them in the script
at the location for sources.

The conv_ assumes an existing project.
The make_ assumes no existing project.

To use:

1. Edit the variables at the top of the script to set package name, version, and bug email.
2. Then run: ./make_gnu_proj <project_name>
3. Then cd into the <project_name> directory and you can then do:
	./configure --prefix=/home/foo/
	make
	make install


The main executable will be in /home/foo/bin/ with above. Default is /bin at root without prefix set.
