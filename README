# gnu_autotools_helper
A helper script to create a template GNU autotools project.

Make sure to chmod +x the script. It builds a C template project that works
with GNU Autotools (autoconf and automake).

To use:

1. Edit the variables at the top of the script to set package name, version, and bug email.
2. Then run: ./make_gnu_proj <project_name>
3. Then cd into the <project_name> directory and you can then do:
	./configure --prefix=/home/foo/
	make
	make install


The main executable will be in /home/foo/bin/ with above. Default is /bin at root but a little bit over the top.
